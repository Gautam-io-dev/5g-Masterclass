# CHAPTER 1: THE 5G SYSTEM

1. **ITU :** 

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that focuses on issues related to information and communication 
technologies (ICT). Established in 1865, it plays a crucial role in coordinating global telecommunication standards, policies, and regulations.

Key Functions:

⏺️**Standardization:** ITU develops international standards to ensure interoperability of telecommunications systems and services.

⏺️**Spectrum Management:** It manages the global radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbits to prevent interference between services.

⏺️**Development:** ITU works to bridge the digital divide, promoting access to ICT for developing countries and supporting capacity building.

⏺️**Policy and Regulation:** It provides a platform for governments and private sector stakeholders to discuss and collaborate on telecommunication policies.

2.**THE 5G REQUIREMENTS:**

➡️ Peak data rate (Gbits/s)

➡️ User experienced data rate (Mbits/s) (100mbits/s)

➡️ Spectrum efficiency

➡️ mobility(Km/h) (upto 500km/h)

➡️ latency(ms) (1mili/sec)

➡️ Connection density (10^6 no.of user per^2km)

➡️ Network energy efficient (100x improvement)

➡️ Area traffic capacity (Mbits/s/m2)
