# CHAPTER 1: THE 5G SYSTEM

1. **ITU :** 

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that focuses on issues related to information and communication 
technologies (ICT). Established in 1865, it plays a crucial role in coordinating global telecommunication standards, policies, and regulations.

Key Functions:

⏺️**Standardization:** ITU develops international standards to ensure interoperability of telecommunications systems and services.

⏺️**Spectrum Management:** It manages the global radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbits to prevent interference between services.

⏺️**Development:** ITU works to bridge the digital divide, promoting access to ICT for developing countries and supporting capacity building.

⏺️**Policy and Regulation:** It provides a platform for governments and private sector stakeholders to discuss and collaborate on telecommunication policies.

2.**THE 5G REQUIREMENTS:**

➡️ Peak data rate (Gbits/s)

➡️ User experienced data rate (Mbits/s) (100mbits/s)

➡️ Spectrum efficiency

➡️ mobility(Km/h) (upto 500km/h)

➡️ latency(ms) (1mili/sec)

➡️ Connection density (10^6 no.of user per^2km)

➡️ Network energy efficient (100x improvement)

➡️ Area traffic capacity (Mbits/s/m2)

3.**The 3rd Generation Partnership Project - 3GPP**

3GPP, or the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, is a global collaboration between various telecommunications standards organizations aimed at developing and maintaining technical specifications for mobile communication systems. Founded in 1998, it primarily focuses on standardizing cellular telecommunications technologies, including:

**Key Areas:**

⏺️Mobile Networks: 3GPP is responsible for standards for 3G (UMTS), 4G (LTE), and 5G networks, as well as ongoing work for future generations.

⏺️Technical Specifications: It produces detailed technical documents that define the protocols, architecture, and interfaces used in mobile networks.

⏺️Interoperability: 3GPP ensures that different systems and devices can work together seamlessly, promoting compatibility and efficiency.

⏺️Industry Collaboration: The organization involves various stakeholders, including network operators, equipment manufacturers, software developers, and regulatory bodies, facilitating collaboration across the industry.

**Structure:**

3GPP operates through a series of Technical Specification Groups (TSGs) that focus on different aspects of mobile technology, such as radio access, core network, and services.

**Importance:**

3GPP's work is critical for the advancement of mobile technology, influencing everything from everyday mobile communications to emerging applications like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities.
